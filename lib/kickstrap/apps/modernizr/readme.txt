Please note, using this plugin as is will load modernizr after the page has loaded.

While this will work fine in some cases, this is not the recommended usage of modernizr.
However you may still manually use the script the non-kickstrap way.

Speaking of the script, this is the development version, which means it's full and not minified.

You can grab a customized and minified version at http://modernizr.com
